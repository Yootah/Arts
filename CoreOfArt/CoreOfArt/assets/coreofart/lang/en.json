Or that mixing objects with liquids is only available in a barrel? Anyway, that's not the case anymore!</i><br><br>From now on, you can mix two liquids together. To do this, just pick up the container with the liquid that is in the mixing recipe and press <hk>ctrl</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk> on the container with another liquid from the same recipe placed in the world. It is important to observe several conditions::<br>- there should be enough liquid in the container in your hands for the recipe to work (there may be more liquid - exactly as much as the recipe needs will be used);<br>- there should be enough space in the container placed in the world to accommodate the resulting liquid (its amount is the sum of the original liquids).<br>You can mix liquids in any quantity, but not less than indicated in the recipe. It is only important to keep the proportions.<br><br>Also, some recipes for mixing objects with liquids can now be made in the world! Add salt to water or dissolve minerals in water - now it can be done without using a barrel. Similar to mixing liquids, holding an object in your hand and pressing <hk>ctrl</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk> on a container with liquid, you will mix them.<br><br>All recipes are displayed in the directory.",
